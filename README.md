### File system backend server example for netlify-cms-backend-fs

This example uses a static set of files and no build tools.

**_Warning:_** This is **_ONLY_** an example and **_NOT_** a recommendation to run a Netlify CMS server on your backend. It should only be used in a controlled environment (file corruption can be real) by someone who is familiar with the netlify-cms project and is familiar with running an express server locally. The horrors of a deleted file without a backup can ruin someones day.

Definitely familiarize yourself with the [`netlify-cms-backend-fs`][1] library before playing around with setting up this example.

Now that you are afraid ðŸ˜± to try this example, it can be easy to setup yourself. The example creates an Express server and uses the [`netlify-cms-backend-fs`][1] middleware. The example config and files are the same as the `netlify-cms` dev-test setup, only this example uses the `file-system` backend.

```bash
yarn or npm install
yarn server or npm run-script server
```

The middleware will output where your paths for reading and writing will come from

    netlify-cms-backend-fs (version: x.x.x)
    Root path is <root path>\netlify-cms-server-example
    Site path is <root path>\netlify-cms-server-example

Also let's you know where the endpoints are for the server

    Server listening at http://localhost:3000/
    API listening at http://localhost:3000/api
    CMS listening at http://localhost:3000/admin
